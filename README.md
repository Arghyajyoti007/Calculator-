## üß† Function Breakdown
add(n1, n2)  
Returns the sum.  

subtract(n1, n2)  
Returns the difference.  

multiply(n1, n2)  
Returns the product.  

divide(n1, n2)  
Performs division. If the second number is 0, it safely returns 0.  

calculator(first_num, second_num, operator)  
Uses a dictionary to map operator symbols to their respective functions.  

main_menu()  
Controls the program flow and allows chained or new calculations based on user choice.  

## üí° Enhancements You Can Add
- Add modulus (%) and exponentiation (**) support

- Add input validation for invalid operations or non-numeric input

- Display calculation history

- Create a GUI using Tkinter

- Save calculation logs to a file
